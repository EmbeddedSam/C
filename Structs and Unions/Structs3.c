 *
 * This C program demonstrates the usage of structs and functions
 * to manipulate electric car information. The program initialises
 * variables of the ElectricCar struct type for two different car models
 * (Tesla and Rivian), then uses functions to update, print, and compare car information.

/**
* Function Name: update_car_price
* 
* Function Brief: Updates the price of an ElectricCar struct
* 
* This function takes a pointer to an ElectricCar struct and a new price as inputs.
* It updates the price of the ElectricCar with the new price. The function uses
* a pointer to directly modify the original data, rather than a copy of the struct.
* 
* Function Parameters:
* (1) car A pointer to the ElectricCar struct to be updated
* (2) new_price The new price to set for the ElectricCar
*
* Example usage:
*
* ElectricCar myCar = {"Tesla Model S", 2022, 80000, 100};

void update_car_price(ElectricCar *car, double new_price) {
    car->price = new_price;

// Note for students - In the update_car_price function, we use a pointer to the ElectricCar struct 
// because we want to modify the original car data rather than a copy of it. 
// When you pass a struct to a function, C makes a copy of the struct, so any changes made to the copy inside the function won't affect the original data. 
// By using a pointer, we're passing the memory address of the original struct,  allowing the function to directly modify the original data.
// The -> notation is used to access the members of a struct through a pointer. 
// When you have a pointer to a struct, you can't use the . notation to access its members directly because the pointer holds the memory address of the struct, not the struct itself. 
// The -> operator is a shorthand for dereferencing the pointer and then accessing the member.

/**
 * Function Name: print_car_info
 * Function Brief: Prints the information of an ElectricCar struct
 *
 * This function takes an ElectricCar struct as an input and prints its information,
 * including brand, year, price, and battery capacity. The function uses printf()
 * to display the information in a formatted and human-readable way.
 *
 * Function Prameters: 
 *  (1) car The ElectricCar struct to print the information of
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     ElectricCar myCar = {"Tesla Model S", 2022, 80000, 100};
 *     print_car_info(myCar);

/**
 * Function Name: compare_car_prices
 * Function Brief: Compares the prices of two ElectricCar structs and prints the result
 *
 * This function takes two ElectricCar structs as input and compares their prices.
 * It then prints a message indicating which car is cheaper, or if they have the
 * same price. The function uses printf() to display the comparison result in a
 * human-readable way.
 *
 * Function Parameters:
 *  (1) car1 The first ElectricCar struct to compare
 *  (2) car2 The second ElectricCar struct to compare
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     ElectricCar car1 = {"Tesla Model S", 2022, 80000, 100};
 *     ElectricCar car2 = {"Rivian R1T", 2022, 70000, 105};
